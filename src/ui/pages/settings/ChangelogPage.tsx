    description:
      "Device sync got a ground-up reliability rebuild: conflicts resolve the right way, settings and memories arrive intact, transfers have no size ceiling, and failures say so instead of pretending everything worked. Multi-GPU stopped being a guessing game, five new guided tours walk you through the trickiest parts of the app, and ASR learning data joins sync and backups.",

          "Sync conflict resolution now keeps the newest data instead of the oldest. Previously a fresh install could silently overwrite the host device's real settings, advanced settings, and prompt templates with its own defaults.",
