          <li>• For casual chatting → pick a fast, cheap chat model from your provider/router.</li>

            then upgrade if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            • If something feels off (too slow / too dumb / too expensive) → you can always switch
            models later in LettuceAI.

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="mt-4 text-[11px] text-white/45">
        Always check the provider&apos;s own documentation for the latest model list, limits, and
        pricing. This page is about how to think, not what to buy.
